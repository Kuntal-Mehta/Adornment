Adornment
=========

This repository contains demo adornment I have created using some of the links.

I have understood the things related to add-in. 
 http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/446955/Web-Search-Visual-Studio-Add-in-Search-Google-Yaho would be good link to understand how the add-in works. 

Apart from that http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/envdte.textpoint.codeelement.aspx could also help to understand how the thing works in the reference to capture any specific code element and its position.

I have tried many things to make a proper view expected inside task but I didn't found anything that can help me to make UI as per the expectation.

For that I searched around for some new things named *Adornment* and there are two types of it. 


1. Text Adornment
2. View-port Adornment

Right now I am not sure what to choose and what kind of combination will work for me but to understand how adornment works the reference to the links helped me and I have created two demo adornment and have seen one which comes in built with SDK.
